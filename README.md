# js-solutions

A collection of simple vanilla JS snippets to UI components often seen in web. This is NOT a library or a framework.

The common structure would require index, style and script. All should be ready to copy paste as long as you have Babel ready to convert ES6 to ES5.

### Slider / Toggler of content

ðŸ”— [Code](https://github.com/xavortm/js-solutions/tree/main/src/css-slider)

Not really a slider but a toggler with next/previous and dots for location. Uses classes to indicate active element. With CSS, you can create an animation to move between sliders. Drag is not supported.
